##Pokedex App

We need to create a client for `http://pokeapi.co/`(source of info about pokemons).

It should look as following: [selected view](https://goo.gl/SnsnPO)

On click of ‘Load More’ another chunk of the list is being loaded and displayed on the page. Pokemon details should be displayed after clicking on the single pokemon in list. Previously shown pokemon details should disappear.

Bonus points for implementing:
  - Adaptive styling (able to view this on all screen widths)
  - Filter visible pokemons by type
